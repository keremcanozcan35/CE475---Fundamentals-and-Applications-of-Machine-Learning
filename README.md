# CE475 Fundamentals and Applications of Machine Learning

        Identification and Significance of the Problem

In this project, I tried to figure out missing values from the given dataset from the
instructor of this course. The aim of the project is to predict the output for the given input
label. I used sci-kit learn library to implement the methods that we covered in the class. And,
trying to predict something with the given information is a great thing, it is definitely worth to
try.

        Methodology

First of all, I did research for what I should use in this program, what is the best ways
of doing it. I decided to use Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Support
Vector Machines, Decision Tree, and Random Forest.
